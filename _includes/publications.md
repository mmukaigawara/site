  <b>Objectives:</b> Increases in obesity and cardiovascular diseases contribute to rapidly growing healthcare expenditures in many countries. However, little is known about whether the population-level health guidance intervention for obesity and cardiovascular risk factors is associated with reduced healthcare utilisation and spending. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of population-level health guidance intervention introduced nationally in Japan on healthcare utilisation and spending.<br>
  <b>Design:</b> Retrospective cohort study, using a quasiexperimental regression discontinuity design. <br>
  <b>Setting:</b> Japan’s nationwide employment-based health insurers. Participants Participants in the national health screening programme (from January 2014 to December 2014) aged 40–74 years.<br>
  <b>Predictors:</b> Assignment to health guidance intervention (counselling on healthy lifestyles, and referral to physicians as needed) determined primarily on whether the individual’s waist circumference was above or below the cut-off value in addition to having at least one cardiovascular risk factor.<br>
  <b>Primary and secondary outcome measures:</b> Healthcare utilisation (the number of outpatient visits days, any medication use and any hospitalisation use) and spending (total medical expenditure, outpatient medical expenditure and inpatient medical expenditure) within 3 years of the intervention.<br>
  <b>Results:</b> A total of 51,213 individuals within the bandwidth (±6 cm of waist circumference from the cut-off) out of 113,302 screening participants (median age 50.0 years, 11.9% woman) were analysed. We found that the assignment to the national health guidance intervention was associated with fewer outpatient visit days (−1.3 days; 95% CI, −11.4 to −0.5 days; p=0.03). We found no evidence that the assignment to the health guidance intervention was associated with changes in medication or hospitalisation use, or healthcare spending.<br>
  <b>Conclusion:</b> Among working-age, male-focused Japanese from a health insurer of companies of civil engineering and construction, the national health guidance intervention might be associated with a decline in outpatient visits, with no change in medication/hospitalisation use or healthcare spending.<br>
